# Movie Creds

An App created with React and CSS

### Description

Movie Creds is a movie app that focuses on one very common question, what else was an actor in? The app allows users to search by Movie to pull up the Movie's cast. On the cast screen they're able to click on an actor to pull up their full filmography (the movies they have been in). Clicking on the movie from their filmography list will bring up the full cast of that movie.

The emphasis on this app is to focus on finding out the cast and what other movies the actor was in. Unlike most movie websites and apps this will be focusing on only one main problem and creating a powerful simple solution.
